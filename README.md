# NeRF

Neural Radiance Fields, or NeRF as it's popularly known today is a neural network architecture that is used to generate 3D scenes, given 2D images. NeRF was first proposed by Mildenhall et al. in the paper [NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934)
